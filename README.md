# Pok√©mon Mended Crystal 

![284440153-fdf1413e-f99c-4fa7-9126-d897c5d9edc5](https://github.com/JySzE/Mended-Crystal/assets/70117278/8c78b3e2-d2bc-47f0-b3a3-fceb3b7b0c1e)

Mended Crystal is heavily inspired by [**UberMedic7's Patched-Crystal**](https://github.com/UberMedic7/patched-crystal), There are distinct differences and you can compare them both.

Mended Crystal is a romhack of Pokemon Crystal. Its main goal is to improve rather than change the feel of what gen 2 pokemon is. 

Simple QOL improvements and mostly small cosmetic additions to help make gen 2 feel more effecient and fun to play.

There are no fakemons or original characters in this romhack, infact NONE of the original story is altered at all.

# Here are the romhacks improvements and features:

- [All bug fixes documented in pret repo have been fixed. (except the optional trading compatability ones)](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/docs/bugs_and_glitches.md)

- Altered Title Screen!

- You can obtain all 251 Pokemon without the need to do trades with other people, version exclusives can now be found in the wild and certain evolution methods have been altered as to aid 
in a less convoluted and more logical experience.

- [Change the speed of healing at a Pokemon Center.](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/wiki/Tips-and-tricks#change-the-speed-of-healing-at-a-pok%C3%A9mon-center)

- [Tiles are now still animated even if a text box is open.](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/wiki/Tips-and-tricks#animate-tiles-even-when-textboxes-are-open)

- [Pokemon can now use Field moves without learning them.](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/wiki/Allow-using-a-field-move-if-the-Pokemon-can-learn-it)
   - Requires you to have the HM or TM + the required badge and situation to use field moves.
   - Requires you to have a Pokemon in party that can learn the TM or HM.
   - Do not fear if they do not show up in your pokemon sub menu. Only field moves you manually have to call with no physical interactive object will show up in the sub menu and only when allowed (like fly, flash, sweet scent etc..)
   - For example Fly will only show up when outside and will NOT show up in the submenu if inside a cave or building.
   - For example Surf, Whirpool and Waterfall will never show up in the submenu and will work aslong as you have the HM, Badge required and have a Pokemon in party that can learn it. Simply press A at the object and it will work.
   - For example Headbutt will not show up in the pokemon submenu and only requires you have the TM and a pokemon in party that can learn it. Simply go up to a tree and press A.
   - You are still free to teach your pokemon any TM or HM field move you want! This is simply a nice way of not having to waste a move slot or keep a HM slave around. :)

## Where do I find all 251 Pokemon? 

There is a [**Encounters & Evolutions**](Encounters%20&%20Evolutions.md) list in the repo that tells you the location of all of the adjusted pokemon except mew~!

That one is a secret and can be found by natural playing the game in a very obvious way. (no its not a roaming mon fear not)

## Where do I find fossil Pokemon?

You can find fossils by smashing rocks with rock smash! You can then revive said fossils using a NPC inside the Ruins of Alph Research Center!

## What are these altered evolutions you spoke of?

Pokemon that would normally evolve via trading now can be evolved without any trading using the new item "Link Cord". 

You can purchase the item "Link Cord" at the Goldenrod Department Store 4F.

It works like an evolutionary stone, You can find a complete list here: [**Encounters & Evolutions**](Encounters%20&%20Evolutions.md).

## Is it possible to Trade & Battle in this? 

Yes! But it requires 2 copies of Mended Crystal to work properly, it will not work with vanilla copies or other romhacks.

## Are you going to add more to this romhack?

I plan on adding more as the pret wiki gets updated with more QOL features, but only if I find it worth it. 

If you find any bugs or want to add onto what I've made feel free to submit a pull request and I will check it out :) 

Aslong as it doesnt change the overall feel of gen 2 I am not against adding more!

## To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
